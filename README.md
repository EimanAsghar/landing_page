# Landing Page Project
This project aims to build a multi-section landing page. Often, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu.


## Instructions

This project focus on:
- Navigation
- Section Active State
- Scroll to Anchor
