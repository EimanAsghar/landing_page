# Landing Page Project
This project aims to build a multi-section landing page. Often, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
